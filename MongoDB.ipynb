        "1. Key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases\n",
        "SQL: Structured, uses tables, fixed schema, supports JOINs.\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL (like MongoDB): Flexible schema, stores data in JSON-like documents, better for hierarchical data and horizontal scaling.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why is MongoDB good for modern applications?\n",
        "Schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, fast development cycles, JSON-like documents align well with modern app data models.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a collection in MongoDB?\n",
        "A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication?\n",
        "Through replica sets: multiple copies of data across nodes (1 primary, multiple secondaries) for automatic failover and redundancy.\n",

        "6. Role of indexes in MongoDB\n",
        "Indexes speed up query performance by allowing faster access to documents. Without indexes, MongoDB performs a full collection scan.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline\n",

        "Primary: Handles all write operations\n",

        "\n",
        "16. Purpose of $lookup in aggregation\n",
        "Performs joins between documents in different collections (similar to SQL joins).\n",

        "SQL has full ACID compliance by default\n",
        "\n",
